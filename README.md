# machine-learning-1-semestral-work
This is our group semester project for Machine Learning 1 (4IZ171). We selected a dataset from Kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/fedesoriano/stroke-prediction-dataset) to analyze. Our primary objective is to predict whether a patient has experienced a stroke based on various health and demographic features.
